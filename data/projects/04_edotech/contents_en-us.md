  Hi, I’m Sakuichi Konno, Principal of EdoTec Global School.
  We　appreciate　your　attention to　our　project　to　make　world　leaders　of　young　people　with　war　experience.
  We have started a school which teachs the most sophisticated IT and leadership to Syrian war refugees and Rwandan young generation surviving genocide.

## Overview

![image1](./data/projects/04_edotech/curriculum.jpg)

  What Edo Tech wants is to cultivate world leaders. What Edo Tech offers to war survivors is not mere programming but high-level IT and leadership education

  The target of our project this time is Syrian refugees in Jordan who used to learn IT in Syria, Rwandan college students studying IT in Rwanda, and Rwandan elementary school students.

# Why cultivate leaders to terminate war?
  So far, humans have enjoyed rapidly developed technology and convenient society thanks to it.
  Rockets bring people to space, the Internet facilitates human communication, and the AI helps to reduce humans' burden. However, disastrous manslaughter and famine are still with us.

  Most of us don’t want more victims of war and famine.
  Then, why can’t we put an end to war?

  One reason is, those who are running this world have been those who live in the developed countries. War is far away from them, so they don’t be bothered if there is war somewhere. In other words, they don’t feel strong necessity to eliminate war.-
  Then, what if those who are in trouble if there is war becomes world leaders?

  Syrian and Rwandan young people are such people.-
  They have strong desire to eradicate war and bring world peace through their abhorrent war experience.

  If such war victims can lead the world, we will stand to have more opportunities to abolish war.
  However, they don’t have enough strategy, knowledge, technology, or methodology to become world leaders to eliminate war.

  To support those with high motivation and a strong will, we have launched our project to support in order to make them global leaders to achieve world peace.
# IT to eliminate the causes of war.
  What our project will bring about.

  IT can’t stop war once it has started, but IT can eliminate various causes of war.
  We call such technology Peace Tech.

  We think the dissemination of Peace Tech in young people in conflict-affected areas will lead to world peace.

  Take Rwandan genocide. It is said this tragedy was caused by the conflict between the Hutu and the Tutsi. The essential reason is the food shortage for several years before the slaughter because of bad weather, and the coffee-bean price collapse because food companies cut down coffee-bean buying prices.

  The food shortage and the coffee-bean price collapse together indirectly triggered the slaughter with the toll of 1 million.

(Rwanda now)

  If the plunge of coffee prices by food companies causes conflict, we can connect coffee farmers and consumers directly by e-commerce and IT networking; we can establish a business model without food companies leading to independent deals unaffected by food firms.

  Another Peace Tech is to innovate coffee production itself by IT-driven precision farming.

  Besides world peace, mastery of IT skills leads to better jobs.
  We want to support Rwandan and Syrian youngsters’ independence　through encouraging employment and their own businesses by offering cutting-edge IT skills beyond programming-

# Not only technology!
  A program which utilize IT for society – Social Good Method
  Edo Tec Global hopes our students work as social leaders. So, we teach not only IT skills but also how to use them for humans and society at large.

  In Jordan, where we have started a school for Syrian refugee college students, some 2,000 young people are reported to participate in the Islamic State, or IS.
  If youngsters who have studied engineering or technology or higher education at our school join terrorist organizations, there is no point in giving education.
  To evade this, the curriculum of Social Good Method contains our original contents, such as ‘IT for Social Good’ in which students study cases where IT is used for social contribution activities, ‘Peaceful Mind’ with which to do things peacefully, and ‘Peace Public Relations’-

# Uniqueness of Edo Tec Global School
  Classroom lecture is not enough to make competent leaders.
  In collaboration with local NPOs, we send our students to the websites of social problems. Through trying to find out solutions in the field, they improve problem resolution skills.

  Our students go to our alliance-partner NGOs or individuals in trouble and have interviews to identify the problem.
  Then, they devise resolutions to the problem found, consulting with Edo Tech or the NGO staff.

(The students found children couldn’t go to school because they didn’t have traffic expenses. They devised a plan to introduce a school bus to solve this problem. The money was financed through a donation website.)

  Through this activity, our students improve their skills to identify some social problem and find out its resolutions. They also learn how to fundraise using IT.
  Through this practice, the students can contribute to the community, and this experience really enhances their determination to contribute to their own home countries.

# Your money goes...

(Syrian refugee children. They can’t go to school because they can’t afford traffic expenses. ‘Field Work’ is one of your donation’s destinations. This helps solve such problems with our students and local NGOs.)

  Our Edo Tec Global School has a lot of support from our local partners such as universities and NPOs. They offer classrooms, computers, and network environment.
  However, to give young people free education costs a lot of money, and this is where you can contribute to world peace!
  Do you want a world without war?
  Do you want to do something to make a difference?
