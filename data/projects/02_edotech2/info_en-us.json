  "curator_comment": "In the activities of Edtech Global, I cooperated with Jordan (people with refugees in Syria) and Rwanda. A total of 8 BTC donations gathered from all over the world. I asked from the person who served as a lecturer of the project, but I asked the students pitch on the last day of the class and made a pitch with the title \"What kind of project do you do with this technology?\" I asked them, \"My acquaintance is buying and selling organs, I'd like to think that I can not prevent it from blocking with block chains.\" \"Thanks to those who contributed, I have received various opinion such as ICO etc. If we have the opportunity to fund them ourselves, education of the next generation will self-sustain as ourselves. \" I am also indirect, but by preparing a platform called KIZUNA, I am honored that you got donations from around the world and helped with education. I think that we can broaden the range of activities to Bosnia, Bangladesh etc, so we are eager to support you this time as well.",
