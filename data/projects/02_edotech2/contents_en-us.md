In Syria, the bombing continues even today, in the "classroom" escaping bullets and temporarily placed in the cave, **there is a poster that Japanese are learning under the blue sky after the war**, and it’s written that "we can revive ourselves too".

I noticed by interacting with more than 60 students in the activities of two years. **Every student in the former battlefields have a strong desire to solve social problems as much as possible** so as not to repeat misery.

However, despite they have such thought, in reality, **there were no students who "actually launch social projects".**
We discussed with local universities many times and defined the reason for the following.

We decided to renovate the curriculum, in order to overcome these reasons. So far, we have created it with volunteers, but start to prepare a program incorporating the latest knowledge, under the supervision of experts. (Current curriculum)
The latest IT technology education as “means” to solve social problems.  
Leadership education for leading social projects.

In the new curriculum, students can learn 

1. Recognition of current situation of task
2. Skills for project's progress as milestone preparation and fund management, alternating the lecture and field work under the accompaniment of Edo Tec Global. 

Also, by visiting local NPOs and meeting the role models acting to solve social problems, we encourage students to become leaders and support the launch their project.

**We have operated all activities in voluntarily to bring education to local students free of charge so far.**

However, it costs minimal expenses such as travel fee and printing fee, in order to operate the school continuously and renew the curriculum.

Could you give your warm support so that we can provide education free of charge to students in former battlefields who are engaged in studying aiming a role-modeling "Japan has recovered from the wilderness after the war ".
Thank you for your support!

### My original experience

Nice to meet you. I am Sakuichi Konno, Representative Director of Edo Tec Global. 

![image](./data/projects/02_edotech2/11.jpg)

There are two original reasons I started this project.
I was born in Tokyo, raised in Hokkaido (highly developed area in the field of farming), and had my high school life in Iwate prefecture ( poor area in northern Japan). By this younghood experience, I faced the reality of the fact that “an individual will never be happy if the world is not going through its happiness”. 
Through this experience, I started to think to contribute to make the world without war and poverty.

However, in spite of developing various technologies and enriching the world, the disparity in the world expand and the exploitation doesn't end and the war never cease.

I think this is because "People in developed countries who do not have to worry about " war "and" poverty” are controlling the world."

**Then, what if those who are in trouble with war and poverty can become global leaders?**

The world may change a little.

This is the reason for establishing Edo Tec Global School "to bring up world leaders from youth with experiences of war and poverty".

**Young people in former battlefield are working hard every day, aiming for Japan which has become a developing country by rebuilding after the war.**

**There is always something we can do!**
I wish for your support so much.
